IMPORTANT
   
BACKLOG
    [ ] Links
        [ ] Auto-include selected text in the link
        [ ] Decorator includes spaces
        [ ] Cancel does not cancel the link
    [ ] Server should watch the file system for changes
        [ ] A connected client has a visible page + widgets
        [ ] Push an update to the client any page or widgets change
    [ ] should not try to save any content with null data
    [ ] Clean up the scroll bars on the editor area so they are smaller and less clunky

MAYBE NEVER
    [ ] Start with a smaller window height and expand as items get close to the bottom
    [ ] Link tooltip with options
        - Edit link
        - Open in new tap
        - open in popup
        - delete
        - See stats
    [ ] Try to protect file accesses on the server
    [ ] Ping server regularly to decide if you should reconnect
    [ ] Server should periodically destry unreferenced widgets
        - Load all the pages, Figure out widget ids from the file system
        - Delete any widgets that never appear in the page text
    [ ] Would be nice to put forms into editor and have them work
        - Maybe just override keydown, but we need to not update the widget when editing the form






-- DONE ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    [x] Delete a widget
    [x] Save text widget
        - widgets are saved in their own files
    [x] Reload text widget with page
    [x] When editing a widget, periodically save it
        
    [x] Text widget editing is allll wonky
        - probably because the initial value is calculated from body, which is observable
    [x] Resize corner shows the wrong mouse pointer
    [x] Set up text editing with tinymce
        Account: ericjorg@thejcrew.net 22cowborgsInvading
    [x] Auto completer for bullets: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68564653/tinymce-how-to-auto-convert-text-to-a-bullet-when-user-types/68570784#68570784
    [x] Resize the tinymce editor when the widget resizes
    [x] Tab to indent text
    
    [x] Sometimes there are collisions trying to save a widget
        - don't try to actually save on page load - recompiling can cause many pages to reload
        - Overall, there should be zero storage calls on a page reload
        
        
    [x] Use web sockets to push update notifications to clients
    
    [x] Bug: page is not property reloading when another client changes their page
        [x] Widget details should not be on the widget at all.  
            The App should keep track of all the widgets in a map that is 
            updated separately. 
        [x] Widget should reference page, not app
        - Data is making it over, but mobx is not signalling a reload (does not appear to be related to tinymce)
        - Somehow a widget update is touching the x,y,width,height properties
    [x] Bug: page should not reload if you were the one changing the page
    [x] Page should auto-refresh when changes are detected on the server
        - Use websockets to push
        - Check every minute that websocket is still up
    [x] Should not be able to change a widget's type
    
    
    
    
    [x] Formatting tweaks
        [x] Trim up margins
        [x] 5-color palette scheme with pastel backgrounds

    [x] Should not try to save the page at all when refreshing
    [x] Remember grid setup
    [x] Title pad for each widget
    
    [x] React grid layout: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-grid-layout
        [x] Add new grid items
        [x] compact on column
        [x] Instead of a click - drag an area
