    [x] Save text widget
        - widgets are saved in their own files
    [x] Reload text widget with page
    [x] When editing a widget, periodically save it
        
    [x] Text widget editing is allll wonky
        - probably because the initial value is calculated from body, which is observable

    [x] Auto completer for bullets: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68564653/tinymce-how-to-auto-convert-text-to-a-bullet-when-user-types/68570784#68570784
    [x] Resize the tinymce editor when the widget resizes
    [x] Tab to indent text
    
    [x] Sometimes there are collisions trying to save a widget
        - don't try to actually save on page load - recompiling can cause many pages to reload
        - Overall, there should be zero storage calls on a page reload
        
        
    [x] Use web sockets to push update notifications to clients
    
    [ ] Bug: page is not property reloading when another client changes their page
        [ ] Widget details should not be on the widget at all.  
            The App should keep track of all the widgets in a map that is 
            updated separately. 
        - Data is making it over, but mobx is not signalling a reload (does not appear to be related to tinymce)
        - Somehow a widget update is touching the x,y,width,height properties
    [ ] Bug: page should not reload if you were the one changing the page
    
    [ ] Links
        [ ] Auto-include selected text in the link
        [ ] Decorator includes spaces
        [ ] Cancel does not cancel the link
    
    [ ] Page should auto-refresh when changes are detected on the server
        - Use websockets to push
        - Check every minute that websocket is still up
        
    [ ] Server should watch the file system for changes
        [ ] A connected client has a visible page + widgets
        [ ] Push an update to the client any page or widgets change
