==============================================================================================

    [x] Unit test throttling
    [x] Spacers are a little wrong on the stock graph
        Just use regular time and drop spacers when the hour/day/week/month changes
    [x] Allow ping tool to take http urls and simply try to access them
        - need this for clusterfun
        
    [x] Actions:    
        [x] Open logs
        [x] Open explorer
        [x] Open Task manager

    [ ] Debug page changes
        [ ] Show source location
    [ ] Make it work across machines
        [ ] Watch for file changes: 
            https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar
        [ ] A connected client has a visible page + widgets
        [ ] Push an update to the client any page or widgets change
    [ ] Make a no-compile deployment
    [ ] Make sure deployment instructions are correct
        - a build script would be perfect
        - start checking versions into github
    [ ] remove the api functions and generalize how we call the server model
        
        
    [ ] Documentation update
        [ ] Linux: need to run under sudo
        [ ] If you don't run localhost, then the server runner is not as powerful
    [ ] The dialogcontrol should cover the parent window so overdrags don't create new controls
    [ ] Request:  Page chooser
    [ ] Bug: clicking resize while picking turns off picker
    [ ] Bug: Sometimes text does not save after typing and there is no newline
        - Maybe launch a throttle event on each keystroke
    [ ] Get new secrets for spotify API and weather watcher
    [ ] put secrets in a config file called secrets.env
        - Weather API
        [ ] Make a template file for secrets
        [ ] Auto-create secrets file
    [ ] Auto-create config file for actions
    [ ] Perf: use webworkers to load content
    [ ] Weather watcher
        [ ] Weather server:  https://openweathermap.org/api  (API key is a secret)
        - include space weather http://sws-data.sws.bom.gov.au/
        - Nasa APIs: https://api.nasa.gov/
    
        

NEW ==============================
    [ ] Text editor widget on hompag?
    [ ] Convert to full flex layout
    [ ] An error in the actions file should show up on the page somehow
    [ ] Changing the actions file should cause a reload of actions config
    [ ] Be able to start a playlist from spotify widget
    [ ] Document how to start hompag from task scheduler

        
        
BUGS ====================================

IMPORTANT ==============================
   
BACKLOG ==============================
    [ ] Page fit scaling messes with grid drag and drop
    [ ] Perf: consider memoizing components
    [ ] Perf: Consider compressing server traffic
    [ ] Perf: try removing all inline function devs (they always defeat the stale check)
    [ ] Perf:  15 ms    loadWidgetContent - operation is serial
    [ ] Perf:  27 ms    PageControl- Combobox(5.6), widgetConfigurator(4) 
    [ ] Lyrics in Spotify  https://www.lyrics.com/lyrics_api.php
        [ ] Show as a hovering window off to the side
    [ ] Spotify: Select playlist
        - Should also be able to handle pseudo-playlists
    [ ] Spotify Quiz mode
            [ ] Need a way to store personal data on the server
                - For now, just store the data on the appmodel cache
            [ ] Show Artist: ??? - click to guess
                - will need to load playlist first
                - If not playlist, no guess mode
            [ ] Show title: ???
            [ ] Show % correct for last 10 guesses
            [ ] Once 100%, then just show the artist with a little button to put them back in quiz mode
    [ ] Hovering over links should show url
    [ ] should not try to save any content with null data
    [ ] Clean up the scroll bars on the editor area so they are smaller and less clunky

MAYBE NEVER ==============================
    [x] Perf:   ? ms    TinyMCxE repeat loading of .css files
    [x] Perf: 100 ms    Replace Tinymcxe with your own editor 
    [ ] Perf:   ?       web sockets seem to load multiple times 
    [ ] Perf:   3 ms    AppStyles.module.css 
    [ ] Add a scalable option to put the site inside a page scaler
    [ ] google-like ajax functionality  in the search tool
        - Remember user searches on the widget
        - Do a background search 
    [ ] On the server, periodically purge empty folders and 0-length files
    [ ] In the settings page, report recent errors - switch console.log in error locations to report errors
    [ ] Perf Mobx is expensive (~100ms to render from widget updates)
        https://medium.com/workday-engineering/react-performance-and-mobx-b038085ecb72
        [ ] For batching:
            Batch the loading of content into holder objects, then assign them all in the same action
        [ ] don't create object and lambas in the react compenent declarations
        [ ] Avoid looking at properties of observables until the last second.  eg, avoid this:
            <Mycomponent somevalue={myObservable.value} />
    [ ] Perf Network
    [ ] Local caching to make the page keep working when the server is offline
        - Highest Write ID wins - should be easy to do this if the server is caching too
    [ ] React Service Runner? (Question on reddit)
    [ ] Start with a smaller window height and expand as items get close to the bottom
    [ ] Link tooltip with options
        - Edit link
        - Open in new tap
        - open in popup
        - delete
        - See stats
    [ ] Try to protect file accesses on the server
    [ ] Ping server regularly to decide if you should reconnect
    [ ] Server should periodically destry unreferenced widgets
        - Load all the pages, Figure out widget ids from the file system
        - Delete any widgets that never appear in the page text
    [ ] Would be nice to put forms into editor and have them work
        - Maybe just override keydown, but we need to not update the widget when editing the form






-- DONE ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    [x] Add debug widget that shows stats such as:
            render frequency
            message frequency/bandwidth
            memory size
            
    [x] Stock API setup
        [x] Get query working
            https://rapidapi.com/alphavantage/api/alpha-vantage/pricing
                Click Subscribe
        [x] Cache and throttle requests
            - start by getting intraday, daily, and monthly - start with daily and schedule the other ones 
                to spread out the query times
            - track last request time
            - only get daily if last time was more than 24 hours ago
            - Spread out queries to be < 5/min
            - don't issue requests outside of trading hours
            - shrink data size by reporting a single item like this:  [ 22.32,1.33,-3.11,.04] [close,+,-,Mshares]
        [x] This is wrong:
            appModel.addMessageListener("StockUpdate", (data: any) => {
            The message is a transient_update, so I need to hook into that
        [x] For some reason, not seeing current day data
        [x] Always trying to get monthly data - should only happen once
        [x] A full await on stock data causes a timeout error on the client
        [x] track recent requests so we can be accurate about our request rate
        [x] Don't query outside of trading hours
        [x] Have the query auto-space itself so that we don't pull down everything at once
        [x] Shoot for every 10 minutes
    [x] Stop ping for stocks that haven't been posted for 2 hours
    [x] Stock ticker widget
        [x] Preliminary formatting

            [x] Click for detailed quotes  

    [x] New Widget: Shell Commander - run shell commands via the server
        [x] The observable picked actions is not getting reserialized as observable
        
    [x] Check out the makeobservable decorator: https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=7e0a3cd836d3e544dbd9&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Fauth%2Fgithub%2Fcallback%3Freturn_to%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgist.github.com%252FMichealPearce%252F56418455bcd3ceb2e666fc097b4e0602&response_type=code&state=3d1204e7f73493dc6ed13bb7ee79ccc54627724c35562e666feece07eeb22e41

    [x] Ping Widget
        [x] Click to add a new ping
            Name, URL, optional regexp, option auth header
        [x] Send ping requests to server on startup
        [x] Server pings every minute with jitter
        [x] Server only pings for 8 hours - pings should naturally recur as the page is loaded
        [x] pings reported through sockets
            - THis is tricky because pings can come in at any time and we want to share them
            - pinger could have a way to just generally listen for pings and do an update 
              when the id is of one we care about
        [x] Click x to delete a ping with confirmation dialog
        [x] Click pencil on ping to edit it

    [x] Generic method for registering a widget       
    [x] Bug: Cached items are overwriting newer data on the server

            [x] On mouse enter
            [x] On clicks
        [x] Client sends play commands to server
        [x] Server forwards commands to spotify
        [x] After sending command, Server re-requests state and forwards to clients
            - Clients keep widget state as transient values
        [x] Keep spotify secrets in the config
        [x] Client shows player API 
            - Show proper text when the api is not playing

            - Version you save is actually wrong - don't serialize it
            - Mark the version as -1 to signal that you are in the middle of saving the page
                or maybe use setTimeout on the server to send the updates
                or maybe just both
        [x] pass the page widget list to server and get all the versions
        [x] For each widget, if the version is newer, load from the server
